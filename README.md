## Introduction

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) are a new class of generative models that offer a stable and effective alternative to traditional approaches like GANs and VAEs. In DDPMs, data generation occurs by reversing a gradual noise-adding process. The model is trained to denoise step-by-step, starting from random noise and progressively recovering the original data distribution. This approach, based on denoising score matching and diffusion processes, allows for high-quality sample generation while avoiding common issues in GANs, such as training instability and mode collapse, and producing sharper results compared to VAEs.
